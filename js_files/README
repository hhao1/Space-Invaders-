The player can use left and right to control the game.
When the allien has been cleaned, the player win.
if the allien get to the bottom, or you has been hit by the bullet, player lose.

I have only modified main.js. other files are from the professor. I have not do any modifications on them.

During the assignment I have stucked on the direction function. I got help from classmate Harry Cui. But all the coding and rest of the work was by myself.
